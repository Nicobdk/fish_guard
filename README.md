# 🐟 FishGuard — AI-Powered Aquaculture Monitoring

FishGuard is an AI-driven solution using underwater cameras and water-quality sensors to detect stress, diseases and abnormal fish behavior in real-time.  
Its goal is to prevent mass mortality, reduce losses and bring accessible automation to aquaculture farms.
